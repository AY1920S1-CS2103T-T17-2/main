== About the project

My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic https://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/command-line-interface-CLI[Command Line Interface (CLI)] desktop addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. Our constraint is that we have to target users who are able to type fast and prefer typing over other means of input.

With the stated constraint in mind, we choose to morph the given addressbook application into an travelling companion application which synthesis various kinds of features including financial tracker, diary, itinerary planner, contacts and achievement. This enhanced application allows users who love to travel to plan their trip beforehand, record down their expenses and write down their precious memories during travel. We ensured that the users have to type commands and instructions for all of the added features.

This is what our project looks like: +

=== My Role
My role was to design and write the codes for the Financial Tracker feature. The following sections illustrate my contributions in detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these contributions.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my contributed feature and other relevant contributions to the team project.

*Major contributions*

Financial Tracker:

* What is it?

    The Financial Tracker is an expense recorder whereby users can keep track of the records of their spending during their trips to different countries.

* Justification

    Our target users which we have chosen are NUS students who love to travel. During our users analysis, we realised that students nowadays are very likely to overspend their budget during
    travelling. Therefore, this financial tracker feature allows our target users to keep a record of their spending in order to remind them of their budget.

* More to it

    Users could also generate an overview of their expenses in an easy-to-look pie chart form!

*Minor contributions*

Project management:

* Started implementing Ui components and link them to FXML. This provides skeletal codes for the rest of my teammates to adapt with.
* Modified command Command class to be generic so that the other Command classes in other features can take in their own Model classes.

Enhancements to existing features:

* Updated the Main page's Ui:

Community:

* PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments):
* Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class:
