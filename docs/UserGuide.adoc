== Preface

Nobody likes to read long documents, especially when you have something as
exciting as TravEzy to start using. So, we're going to give you a simple structure
that you can use to make using this user guide a TravEzy experience üòä:


We've split up this guide into the different portions of our application, namely:

. Main
. Calendar
. Itinerary
. Address Book
. Diary
. Achievements


In each portion, you will find the commands that you can type to begin making use of the feature.
We have provided the word that you type into TravEzy to trigger the
command, or the _Command Word_  in a special format, for example -  ``Command Word``. With this, there
is a short description of the command as well.

After the _Command Word_, we have also included the _Format_ for entering the command.
Now, in TravEzy, along with the _Command Word_, we also have additional parameters
that must be typed in with the _Command Word_. These parameters are made explicit with
_Prefixes_. Each prefix will be followed by a forward slash, ``/``, after which will be value that you, the user must input. If the parameter is optional, it will be surrounded by sqaure brackets,
``[]``.

Lastly, with each command, there is an example of a possible command that can be input by a user.

Here, is an example from the diary:

Trying to journal your trip to DisneyLand?
*Add an entry to your diary: ``add``*

Adds an entry to your diary, with the parameters: title (of the diary entry), date
(of the event you are trying to journal) , place (of the event) and memory (more info
about the event).

The _Command Word_ is ``add`` and the prefixes are ``t/`` for title, ``d/``
for date, ``p/`` for place and ``m/`` for memory.
Only title and date are compulsory.

Format: ``add t/title d/date [p/place] [m/memory]``

Example: Lets take the example of my fishing trip! I can't really remember where it was...

``add t/Fishing Trip d/12/12/2019 m/Caught the biggest fish ever!``
