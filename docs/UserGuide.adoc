== Preface

Nobody likes to read long documents, especially when you have something as
exciting as TravEzy to start using. So, we're going to give you a simple structure
that you can use to make using this user guide a TravEzy experience üòä:


We've split up this guide into the different portions of our application, namely:

. Main
. Calendar
. Itinerary
. Address Book
. Diary
. Achievements


In each section, you will find the commands that you can type to begin making use of the features.
We have provided the word that you type into TravEzy to trigger the
command, or the _Command Word_  in a special format, for example -  ``Command Word``. With this, there
is a short description of the command as well.

After the _Command Word_, we have also included the _Format_ for entering the command.
Now, in TravEzy, along with the _Command Word_, we also have additional parameters
that must be typed in with the _Command Word_. These parameters are made explicit with
_Prefixes_. Each prefix will be followed by a forward slash, ``/``, after which will be value that you, the user must input. If the parameter is optional, it will be surrounded by sqaure brackets,
``[]``.

Lastly, with each command, there is an example of a possible command that can be input by a user.

Here, is an example from the diary:

Trying to journal your trip to DisneyLand?
*Add an entry to your diary: ``add``*

Adds an entry to your diary, with the parameters: title (of the diary entry), date
(of the event you are trying to journal) , place (of the event) and memory (more info
about the event).

The _Command Word_ is ``add`` and the prefixes are ``t/`` for title, ``d/``
for date, ``p/`` for place and ``m/`` for memory.
Only title and date are compulsory.

Format: ``add t/title d/date [p/place] [m/memory]``

Example: Lets take the example of my fishing trip! I can't really remember where it was...

``add t/Fishing Trip d/12/12/2019 m/Caught the biggest fish ever!``




== Main
Hi!

Main is the welcome screen for TravEzy. From here, you can navigate to the other pages, such as calendar,
financial tracker, achievements etc. You can also the exit the application from here.

Don't worry! You can also navigate to other pages
and exit when you are already inside in a page such as itinerary.

=== Go To Command

Trying to open up the achievements page? Use the *Go To Command*:

*Go To another page: ``goto``*

Allows you to navigate to different pages (from any page), with the possible pages being:

. main
. calendar
. itinerary
. address_book
. financial_tracker
. diary
. achievements

The _Command Word_ is `goto` and the parameter can be any of the pages listed above. There is no
need for a _Prefix_.

Format: ``goto page``

Example: Let's say I want to go back to the main page to see the beautiful TravEzy logo -

``goto main``


=== Exit Command

It's time to catch your flight! Better exit TravEzy using the *Exit Command* and
start your trip!

*Exit TravEzy: ``exit``*

Allows you to exit from TravEzy

The _Command Word_ is `exit` and there are no additonal parameters.

Format: ``exit``

Example: Let's say I have to exit the calendar page -

``exit``

== Calendar

We have all been there. It's the end of the semester but we still have orientation camps to plan, upcoming projects for our CCA, hackathons to attend, internships to complete, family commitments, etc. However, we have worked so hard and *really* want to go for a trip with our friends and unwind. Sounds like you this semester? 

Well, TravEzy has got you covered. Simply inform TravEzy of your schedule (your commitments, school breaks and public holidays) and TravEzy will suggest periods of time when you can travel! Excited to find out more? Well... Read on!

=== Interface

=== Parameters

Let us find out what are the main parameters (or fields, just like those which you fill up in a regular formüìù).

. DAY. This refers to which day of the month (e.g. *1*, *2*, ..., *31* of January). To specify the day, simply place ``d/`` before it.
+ 
For example, if you would like to specify that is it first of January, key in:

    d/1


. MONTH. This refers to which month (i.e. *January*, *February*, *March*, ..., *December*) you would like to refer to. To specify the month, just place ``m``. Since people have different ways of specifying month, TravEzy has tried to accommodate these differences. In particular, you may choose to refer to it using numbers (with *1* referring to *January*, *2* referring to *February*, etc.) or you may choose to refer to it using words. Please type *at least the first three letters* of the month üòÑ.
+ 
Referring to the previous example, to specify that it is January, you can type:

    m/1
    
+ 
or you can type:

    m/Jan

+ 
or:

    m/January
    
. YEAR. This refers to which year (i.e. *2019*, *2020*, ...) you are referring to. To indicate the year, prepend the year with ``y/``. Since TravEzy allows you to refer to any year between 1970 and 2200 (because travelling in time is fun too!), please key in a *4 digit number* . If otherwise, it would be confused üòî. 
+ 
For instance, if you want to specify the year 2019, just key in:

    y/2019

. END DAY. This refers to the day of the last date. This is very similar to how you would specify the (start) DAY, as mentioned in point 1. Now, instead of using the small letter, use the capitalised version. In other words, ``D/``. 
+
For example, if you would like to indicate that your event (i.e. commitment, holiday, school break or trip) ends on fifth of January, enter:

    D/5

. END MONTH. This refers to the month of the last date. Again, this is very similar to how you would specify the (start) MONTH, as mentioned in point 2. Now, instead of using the small letter, use the capitalised version ``M/``. 
+
Following from the above example, if you would like to state that your event ends (i.e. commitment, holiday, school break or trip) ends in January, just type:

    M/1
+
Alternatively, if you are more comfortable with spelling the month out in words, TravEzy also understands:

    M/Jan
+    
and:

    M/January
+
IMPORTANT: As with the above (MONTH), if you are spelling END MONTH in words, please specify it with *at least the first three letters* of the month.

. END YEAR. This refers to the year of the last date. Similarly, to specify the year of the last date, key in the capitalised version instead. In essence, place ``Y/`` before the year of the last date. How simple is that?
+
For instance, if your trip ends in 2020, just type:

    Y/2020
+   
IMPORTANT: As with the above (YEAR), please specify END YEAR using *four digits*.
+
TIP: As expected, specifying the END DAY, END MONTH and/or END YEAR is not always applicable. Hence, by default, TravEzy assumes that the END DAY, END MONTH and/or END YEAR are the same as DAY, MONTH and/or YEAR respectively. 

. NAME. This refers to the name of your event (i.e. commitment, holiday, school break or trip). To indicate the name, just key in ``n/`` before it. 
+
For instance, if you would like to specify that the holiday you are adding refers to Christmas üéÑ , just type:

    n/Christmas

. INFO. This refers to any additional information associated with your event (i.e. commitment, holiday, school break or trip). To include this, just type ``i/`` before you start typing the relevant information. 
+
For example, if you would like to include the fact that your grandparents are coming for christmas this year to remind yourself that you definitely have to make time for them, you can do so by typing:

    i/Grandparents will be here!!
    
. EVENT TYPE. This refers to either a commitment, holiday, school break or trip. With this parameter, you can easily differentiate the different events in your calendar!
+
Are you unable to travel on a particular day or over a duration of time due to commitments? Well, indicate it with ``commitment``!
+ 
For instance, if you have volunteered to tutor children from 2 to 5 December 2019, you can refer to it by typing:
    
    commitment n/volunteer to tutor children d/2 m/Dec y/2019 D/5 M/Dec Y/2019

+
Now, TravEzy would know that the event is in fact a commitment!
+
{empty} +
Or is there an upcoming public holiday? Then, key it in with the type ``holiday``.
+
For example, to refer to the fact that 1 May 2020 is labour day (a public holiday), just enter:
    
    holiday n/labour day d/1 m/May y/2020

+
Now, TravEzy would recognise that day as a public holiday!
+
{empty} +
You might then be wondering, what if it is a school break? As you might have expected, TravEzy has got that covered too! Just indicate that the event is in fact a school break by keying in ``school_break``.
+ 
For instance, if you would like to refer to the fact that 8 Dec 2019 to 12 Jan 2020 is winter vacation (a school break), just type:

    school_break n/winter vacation d/8 m/Dec y/2019 D/12 M/Jan Y/2020
    
+ 
Yeah! Now, TravEzy know that you are referring to a school break. üòâ 
+
{empty} +
Last but not least, you can specify that you will be away for a trip (woo hoo!) by using the EVENT TYPE ``trip``.
+
For example, to refer to your Bali trip between 10 Dec 2019 to 13 Dec 2019, simply enter:
    
    trip n/Bali 3D2N d/10 m/Dec y/2019 D/13 M/Dec Y/2019

+ Great! Now, TravEzy is aware that you are referring to a trip.

=== Add Command

Whew! After reading so much, it is time to find out how you can add your event, be it your commitment, holiday, school break or trip, so that TravEzy can start suggesting when you can travel! üòä

*Add an event to your calendar: ``add``

Add it to your calendar with the EVENT TYPE ``holiday``! Or... Is it your school break? Well, we have got that covered to! Just add it to your calendar with the EVENT TYPE ``school_break``. Hmm... Or may it is your long-coveted *trip*! Can you add that to your calendar too? You bet!

== Diary

The sweetest part of any holiday is looking back at your fond memories. TravEzy's
Diary allows you to do just that!

Each entry in your diary has 4 key sections:

. Title
. Date
. Place
. Memory

The title is the name of your entry, followed by the date of your memory, the place and finally
a short description of the memory you want to keep. In the Diary, you will be able to add, delete,
list and show your entries. There are also a few more special tasks that you can do with your diary.
Enjoy!


=== Parameters

Let's shed some light on the parameters and how exactly you can type them in to begin creating
your diary entries:

. *Title* -> *COMPULSORY* Each diary entry must have a title. This title can be anything! The corresponding _PREFIX_ is ``t/``. For example:

    t/My Birthday

. *Date* -> *COMPULSORY* Each diary entry must have a date and time. The _PREFIX_ is `d/`. There is one way to input your date and time, but don't worry! It's really simple. You will have to enter it in this format:   `dd/MM/yyyy HHmm`. Let's say your birthday was celebrated on 27th January, 1997 at 11.59PM. Then, you would input:

            d/ 27/01/1997 2359



. *Place*  -> *OPTIONAL*. Now, you may not remember each and every place that you did
something memorable, but if you do, you can add it into your entry with the _PREFIX_ ``p/``:

    p/Sweet Home Alabama

. *Memory*  -> *OPTIONAL*. Not all memories can be expressed in words. If you can, just add a short note of your memory using the _PREFIX_ ``m/``:

    m/Rode a bike for the first time





=== Add Command

Trying to journal your trip to DisneyLand?

``add t/Fishing Trip d/12/12/2019 m/Caught the biggest fish ever!``



=== Delete Command

For some memories, it's best to forget them :(

== FAQ

*Q:* How do I backup my data onto cloud storage? +
*A:* Locate The Traveller Diary folder in your local drive and compact it into a zip file before uploading it onto a cloud storage online.

*Q:* How do I transfer my data onto another computer? +
*A:* Install The Traveller Diary in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with during start up with the file that contains the data of your previous TTD. Alternatively, you can store it in a cloud storage it first before retrieving it and transferring it into your new computer.

*Q:* Can I change the theme of the application? I prefer to work with a night theme interface. +
*A:* Stay tuned for TravEzy v2.0 for this features! The TravEzy theme also aims to provide user with a UI that they are
comfortable with. Hence, we strongly believe giving users the option to personalize their theme is extremely useful
and would greatly consider adding it for the upcoming major update on TravEzy! Stay tuned for that!

*Q:* Who can view my travel posts in my TTD? +
*A:* As TTD is a single user application, it is not opened to the public, and unable to be viewed by others. Hence, it is called ‚Äúdiary‚Äù for a reason, which stores discrete entries reporting events that happened throughout the day. Users can however, showcase their application in front of their friends to show off their overseas trips. +

*Q:* Is it possible to connect to social media such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram? +
*A:* Currently, it is not possible to connect to social media using TTD. However, we will consider implementing this feature in the future! Stay tuned for that! üòâ

*Q:* Is there any in-app purchase for this application? +
*A:* NO there isn‚Äôt. TTD is created from a non-profit organization and we are not here to milk any of your gold coins! It is absolutely free! It cost nothing, zilch, nada, Èõ∂, nil, kosong. So what are you waiting for get TTD today!

*Q:* I‚Äôm having difficulties uploading the pictures onto the travel diary. +
*A:* At the moment, TravEzy does not have any feature where it allows the user to store their travel photos. However,
this will definitely be implemented in v2.0. We intend for the pictures to be stored in the user's local drive and
subsequently in a cloud database which is stored online. The Traveller Diary initial uploads will only allow uploads
of pictures that are in jpg or png. Unfortunately, we do not support gif.
Do ensure that your pictures are below 25MB with the dimensions no bigger than 1920px x 1080px.

*Q:* Who can I contact should there be a bug or feedback that I would like to share? +
*A:* Feel free to send an email to the developer team: mailto:thetravellerdiary@gmail.com[thetravellerdiary@gmail.com] and we will access to your queries within three working days. We also value your feedback and will use it to improve TTD. Thank you and looking forward to serving you better!
