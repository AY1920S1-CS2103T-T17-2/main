=== Structure of this Document

Nobody likes to read long documents, especially when you have something as exciting as TravEzy to use. So, we have organised this document such that you can easily look for what *you* need. 

We've split up this guide into the different features of our application, namely:

. Main
. Calendar
. Itinerary
. Address Book
. Diary
. Achievements


In each of the above sections, you will be introduced to the *interface* of the feature, the *_parameters_* (which are just like those fields you fill up in a regular formüìù) and the *commands* that will do the menial tasks for you.


=== Reading this Document

Symbols and fanciful (okay, different) fonts are exciting, aren't they? Let's find out more about what they mean in this document!

.Symbols and fonts (rows)
[grid="rows", frame="none"]
|===
| Symbol/font | What does it mean?

| _italics_
| An italicised text indicates that the text has a definition that is (rather) specific to the application. Do look out for the definitions of these words along the way. If not, please look at the glossary in section 13).
 
| ``command``
| A grey highlight means that you can type the words into _TravEzy_ and it will start performing tasks for you

| ``MONTH``
| Uppercase letters that are highlighted in grey indicate that the word is a _parameter_.footnote:[Remember what this means? A parameter is merely like a field in your regular form. Just replace it and fill it up with anything appropriate. üòä]

| ``m\MONTH``
| The slash and letter (or word) before the _parameter_ is a _prefix_. It is used to separate the current _parameter_ from other _parameters_.

| ``[m\MONTH]``
| Square brackets imply that the the stated _prefix_ and _parameter_ are optional. (This means less typing! üòÜ)

| üí°  
| A light bulb indicates that what is to follow is a tip. 

| ‚ö†Ô∏è  
| A warning sign indicates that what is to follow is important.

== Itinerary

It's always good to plan ahead for each day of your trip. Start planning your schedule with TravEzy Itinerary planner today and be amazed by
the increase in your day's productivity!

Each entry in your Itinerary has 6 key sections:

. Title
. Date
. Time
. Location
. Description
. Tag

The title is the name of the event. This is followed by the date and time for the execution of that event.
Lastly, the location and description are additional details of the event. Example of your events could include
hiking Mt. Everest, visiting Tokyo Disneyland, or even doing CS2103T user guide! Be amazed with how much you can actually
do within the 24 hours you are given everyday. Let's stop skiving and dive right into productivity.

=== Interface

Upon navigating to the itinerary page, this is how the itinerary page looks like:

.Itinerary Interface
image::/images/ItineraryInterface.png[]

=== Parameter

Let's start off with understanding how each parameter work first!

When inputting an event into the Itinerary, every fields are *compulsory*. However, the *location* and
*description* fields need not be specified. If you did not indicate the *location* and *description* field, the default
value "-" will be used instead.

Below are the _PREFIX_ convention that TravEzy's Itinerary will be using.

. Title: The _PREFIX_ is ``title/``. This is the crux of every event as it provides a name to the event that you
intend to do. For example:

    title/Do CS2103T developer guide

. Date: The _PREFIX_ is ``date/``. TravEzy itinerary allows dates that starts from the year 1000 up till the year 3999.

. Location: The _PREFIX_ is ``l/``. This is the place where your event is happening at it could be a country or just
a venue. For example:

    location/Singapore      or      location/Outer Space

. Description: The _PREFIX_ is ``d/``. You can type in just a word, phrase or sentence.

    d/pen       or      d/pen pineapple apple pen

. Tag: You can select from the dropdown menu to select the importance of each event is through the various priority tagging
available. The default priority tagging is set to *Priority: None*. There is no prefix for the tagging field and you're
not allowed to edit it :(

*Q:* How do I transfer my data onto another computer? +
*A:* Install The Traveller Diary in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with during start up with the file that contains the data of your previous TTD. Alternatively, you can store it in a cloud storage it first before retrieving it and transferring it into your new computer.

*Q:* Can I change the theme of the application? I prefer to work with a night theme interface. +
*A:* Stay tuned for TravEzy v2.0 for this features! The TravEzy theme also aims to provide user with a UI that they are
comfortable with. Hence, we strongly believe giving users the option to personalize their theme is extremely useful
and would greatly consider adding it for the upcoming major update on TravEzy! Stay tuned for that!

*Q:* Who can view my travel posts in my TTD? +
*A:* As TTD is a single user application, it is not opened to the public, and unable to be viewed by others. Hence, it is called ‚Äúdiary‚Äù for a reason, which stores discrete entries reporting events that happened throughout the day. Users can however, showcase their application in front of their friends to show off their overseas trips. +

*Q:* Is it possible to connect to social media such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram? +
*A:* Currently, it is not possible to connect to social media using TTD. However, we will consider implementing this feature in the future! Stay tuned for that! üòâ

*Q:* Is there any in-app purchase for this application? +
*A:* NO there isn‚Äôt. TTD is created from a non-profit organization and we are not here to milk any of your gold coins! It is absolutely free! It cost nothing, zilch, nada, Èõ∂, nil, kosong. So what are you waiting for get TTD today!

*Q:* I‚Äôm having difficulties uploading the pictures onto the travel diary. +
*A:* At the moment, TravEzy does not have any feature where it allows the user to store their travel photos. However,
this will definitely be implemented in v2.0. We intend for the pictures to be stored in the user's local drive and
subsequently in a cloud database which is stored online. The Traveller Diary initial uploads will only allow uploads
of pictures that are in jpg or png. Unfortunately, we do not support gif.
Do ensure that your pictures are below 25MB with the dimensions no bigger than 1920px x 1080px.

*Q:* Who can I contact should there be a bug or feedback that I would like to share? +
*A:* Feel free to send an email to the developer team: mailto:thetravellerdiary@gmail.com[thetravellerdiary@gmail.com] and we will access to your queries within three working days. We also value your feedback and will use it to improve TTD. Thank you and looking forward to serving you better!
