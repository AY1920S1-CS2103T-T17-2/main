What is _TravEzy_? 

_TravEzy_ is a desktop application with a command line interface (CLI) and is *perfect* for NUS students who love travelling as much as we do. With a CLI, you will be able to type in your commands much faster than similar applications which require you to keep using your mouse.

_TravEzy_ is perfect for:

. Managing your busy calendar and finding a good time to take that much needed holiday!

. Creating an ideal itinerary for your trips :)

. Tracking your expenses during your trip, so that you have enough money left for the trip home

. Journaling in your travel diary and effortlessly looking at old entries to recall your favourite moments

. Keep in contact with your old and new friends with the help of _TravEzy's_ address book

== Itinerary

It's always good to plan ahead for each day of your trip. Start planning your schedule with TravEzy Itinerary planner today and be amazed by
the increase in your day's productivity!

Each entry in your Itinerary has 6 key sections:

. Title
. Date
. Time
. Location
. Description
. Tag

The title is the name of the event. This is followed by the date and time for the execution of that event.
Lastly, the location and description are additional details of the event. Example of your events could include
hiking Mt. Everest, visiting Tokyo Disneyland, or even doing CS2103T user guide! Be amazed with how much you can actually
do within the 24 hours you are given everyday. Let's stop skiving and dive right into productivity.

=== Interface

Upon navigating to the itinerary page, this is how the itinerary page looks like:

.Itinerary Interface
image::/images/ItineraryInterface.png[]

=== Parameter

Let's start off with understanding how each parameter work first!

When inputting an event into the Itinerary, every fields are *compulsory*. However, the *location* and
*description* fields need not be specified. If you did not indicate the *location* and *description* field, the default
value "-" will be used instead.

Below are the _PREFIX_ convention that TravEzy's Itinerary will be using.

TravEzy Itinerary will reformat the time into 12 hour format when shown on the card. For example:

    time/0000

. Location: The _PREFIX_ is ``l/``. This is the place where your event is happening at it could be a country or just
a venue. For example:

    location/Singapore      or      location/Outer Space

. Description: The _PREFIX_ is ``d/``. You can type in just a word, phrase or sentence.

    d/pen       or      d/pen pineapple apple pen

. Tag: You can select from the dropdown menu to select the importance of each event is through the various priority tagging
available. The default priority tagging is set to *Priority: None*. There is no prefix for the tagging field and you're
not allowed to edit it :(

== Diary

The sweetest part of any holiday is looking back at your fond memories. TravEzy's
Diary allows you to do just that! Here is our Diary!

image::DiaryInterface.png[width=800]


In TravEzy, we have broken down your memories into 4 key parts, namely _Title_, _Date and Time_, _Place_ and _Memory_.

For example, here is a Diary Entry about our trip to Tioman

. _Title_ -> First time Snorkeling
. _Date and Time_  -> 30/12/2019 0900
. _Place_ -> Tioman Island
. _Memory_ -> Saw so may beautiful fish!

In the Diary, you will be able to add, delete, list and show your entries. There are also a few more special tasks that you can do with your diary.
Enjoy!

*A:* Locate The Traveller Diary folder in your local drive and compact it into a zip file before uploading it onto a cloud storage online.

*Q:* How do I transfer my data onto another computer? +
*A:* Install The Traveller Diary in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with during start up with the file that contains the data of your previous TTD. Alternatively, you can store it in a cloud storage it first before retrieving it and transferring it into your new computer.

*Q:* Can I change the theme of the application? I prefer to work with a night theme interface. +
*A:* Stay tuned for TravEzy v2.0 for this features! The TravEzy theme also aims to provide user with a UI that they are
comfortable with. Hence, we strongly believe giving users the option to personalize their theme is extremely useful
and would greatly consider adding it for the upcoming major update on TravEzy! Stay tuned for that!

*Q:* Who can view my travel posts in my TTD? +
*A:* As TTD is a single user application, it is not opened to the public, and unable to be viewed by others. Hence, it is called ‚Äúdiary‚Äù for a reason, which stores discrete entries reporting events that happened throughout the day. Users can however, showcase their application in front of their friends to show off their overseas trips. +

*Q:* Is it possible to connect to social media such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram? +

*Q:* I‚Äôm having difficulties uploading the pictures onto the travel diary. +
*A:* At the moment, TravEzy does not have any feature where it allows the user to store their travel photos. However,
this will definitely be implemented in v2.0. We intend for the pictures to be stored in the user's local drive and
subsequently in a cloud database which is stored online. The Traveller Diary initial uploads will only allow uploads
of pictures that are in jpg or png. Unfortunately, we do not support gif.
Do ensure that your pictures are below 25MB with the dimensions no bigger than 1920px x 1080px.

*Q:* Who can I contact should there be a bug or feedback that I would like to share? +
