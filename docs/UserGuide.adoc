== Preface

Nobody likes to read long documents, especially when you have something as
exciting as TravEzy to start using. So, we're going to give you a simple structure
that you can use to make using this user guide a TravEzy experience üòä:


We've split up this guide into the different portions of our application, namely:

. Main
. Calendar
. Itinerary
. Address Book
. Diary
. Achievements


In each portion, you will find the commands that you can type to begin making use of the feature.
We have provided the word that you type into TravEzy to trigger the
command, or the _Command Word_  in a special format, for example -  ``Command Word``. With this, there
is a short description of the command as well.

After the _Command Word_, we have also included the _Format_ for entering the command.
Now, in TravEzy, along with the _Command Word_, we also have additional parameters
that must be typed in with the _Command Word_. These parameters are made explicit with
_Prefixes_. Each prefix will be followed by a forward slash, ``/``, after which will be value that you, the user must input. If the parameter is optional, it will be surrounded by sqaure brackets,
``[]``.

Lastly, with each command, there is an example of a possible command that can be input by a user.

Here, is an example from the diary:

Trying to journal your trip to DisneyLand?
*Add an entry to your diary: ``add``*

Adds an entry to your diary, with the parameters: title (of the diary entry), date
(of the event you are trying to journal) , place (of the event) and memory (more info
about the event).

The _Command Word_ is ``add`` and the prefixes are ``t/`` for title, ``d/``
for date, ``p/`` for place and ``m/`` for memory.
Only title and date are compulsory.

Format: ``add t/title d/date [p/place] [m/memory]``

Example: Lets take the example of my fishing trip! I can't really remember where it was...

``add t/Fishing Trip d/12/12/2019 m/Caught the biggest fish ever!``

Enjoy!


=== Parameters

Let's shed some light on the parameters and how exactly you can type them in to begin creating
your diary entries:

. *Title* -> *COMPULSORY* Each diary entry must have a title. This title can be anything! The corresponding _PREFIX_ is ``t/``. For example:

    t/My Birthday

. *Date* -> *COMPULSORY* Each diary entry must have a date and time. The _PREFIX_ is `d/`. There is one way to input your date and time, but don't worry! It's really simple. You will have to enter it in this format:   `dd/MM/yyyy HHmm`. Let's say your birthday was celebrated on 27th January, 1997 at 11.59PM. Then, you would input:

            d/ 27/01/1997 2359



. *Place*  -> *OPTIONAL*. Now, you may not remember each and every place that you did
something memorable, but if you do, you can add it into your entry with the _PREFIX_ ``p/``:

    p/Sweet Home Alabama

. *Memory*  -> *OPTIONAL*. Not all memories can be expressed in words. If you can, just add a short note of your memory using the _PREFIX_ ``m/``:

    m/Rode a bike for the first time





=== Add Command

Trying to journal your trip to DisneyLand?
*Add an entry to your diary: ``add``*

Adds an entry to your diary, with the parameters: title (of the diary entry), date
(of the event you are trying to journal) , place (of the event) and memory (more info

The _Command Word_ is ``add`` and the prefixes are ``t/`` for title, ``d/``
for date, ``p/`` for place and ``m/`` for memory.
Only title and date are compulsory.

Format: ``add t/title d/date [p/place] [m/memory]``

Example: Lets take the example of my fishing trip! I can't really remember where it was...

``add t/Fishing Trip d/12/12/2019 m/Caught the biggest fish ever!``



=== Delete Command

For some memories, it's best to forget them :(


*Delete an entry from your diary: ``delete``*

Deletes an entry from your diary with the only parameter being the index of the entry you want to
delete. The index must be an integer which is more than or equal to 1 and corresponds to ID of the
entry you want to delete

The _Command Word_ is ``delete`` and the only parameter is the index.

Format: ``delete index``

Example: I lost my wallet at the amusement park in Genting, I don't want to remember
that trip ever again :(

== FAQ

*Q:* How do I backup my data onto cloud storage? +
*A:* Locate The Traveller Diary folder in your local drive and compact it into a zip file before uploading it onto a cloud storage online.

*Q:* How do I transfer my data onto another computer? +
*A:* Install The Traveller Diary in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with during start up with the file that contains the data of your previous TTD. Alternatively, you can store it in a cloud storage it first before retrieving it and transferring it into your new computer.

*Q:* Can I change the theme of the application? I prefer to work with a night theme interface. +
*A:* Stay tuned for TravEzy v2.0 for this features! The TravEzy theme also aims to provide user with a UI that they are
comfortable with. Hence, we strongly believe giving users the option to personalize their theme is extremely useful
and would greatly consider adding it for the upcoming major update on TravEzy! Stay tuned for that!

*Q:* Who can view my travel posts in my TTD? +
*A:* As TTD is a single user application, it is not opened to the public, and unable to be viewed by others. Hence, it is called ‚Äúdiary‚Äù for a reason, which stores discrete entries reporting events that happened throughout the day. Users can however, showcase their application in front of their friends to show off their overseas trips. +

*Q:* Is it possible to connect to social media such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram? +
*A:* Currently, it is not possible to connect to social media using TTD. However, we will consider implementing this feature in the future! Stay tuned for that! üòâ

*Q:* Is there any in-app purchase for this application? +
*A:* NO there isn‚Äôt. TTD is created from a non-profit organization and we are not here to milk any of your gold coins! It is absolutely free! It cost nothing, zilch, nada, Èõ∂, nil, kosong. So what are you waiting for get TTD today!

*Q:* I‚Äôm having difficulties uploading the pictures onto the travel diary. +
*A:* At the moment, TravEzy does not have any feature where it allows the user to store their travel photos. However,
this will definitely be implemented in v2.0. We intend for the pictures to be stored in the user's local drive and
subsequently in a cloud database which is stored online. The Traveller Diary initial uploads will only allow uploads
of pictures that are in jpg or png. Unfortunately, we do not support gif.
Do ensure that your pictures are below 25MB with the dimensions no bigger than 1920px x 1080px.

*Q:* Who can I contact should there be a bug or feedback that I would like to share? +
*A:* Feel free to send an email to the developer team: mailto:thetravellerdiary@gmail.com[thetravellerdiary@gmail.com] and we will access to your queries within three working days. We also value your feedback and will use it to improve TTD. Thank you and looking forward to serving you better!

*Q:* What are some of the cool features that are available in TravEzy currently? +
*A:* TravEzy currently boast a plethora of features such as calendar, itinerary, address book, travelling diary,
financial tracker and achievements page. All these features work in tandem with each other to give you the best and only
the best travelling experience. Not only that, the TravEzy team also decided to spice things up and included some easter eggs scattered throughout the
